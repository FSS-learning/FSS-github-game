### Game placeholder

# Hello! Thanks for taking part in the FSS GitHub Game!
# Git versioning can be thought of as a slightly more technical version of 
# working with online documents like Google Docs. It allows different users to
# work on the same project, check that the changes that they make to files do not
# conflict with the changes that others have made, and see what changes have been 
# made to files over time. 

# Please do the following:
# 1) Create a branch (copy) of the FSS game GitHub repo on GitHub
# 2) Clone your branch to your computer
# 3) Practice "pulling" your branch from github, to make sure that you are working on 
#    the latest version of the document (remember that other people can work on it 
#    too!)
# 4) Complete the next step of the data treasure trail below. 
#    Write your name and "Done!" next to it, so that the next person can quickly
#    see what needs to be done next. Not that in the real world this is not 
#    required, since Git keeps track of who made which changes and when 
#    (see the playfully-named command "git blame" for more info).
# 5) Stage and then commit your changes, with a clear commit message
# 6) Push your branch back to github
# 7) Create a merge request and wait for Kevin or Juliet to approve your changes
#    to the main branch!

# NOTE: If you do not know how to do a step, ping Juliet for the code solution. 
#       The purpose of the task is for you to learn how to use GitHub, not to
#       struggle with R data analysis. 

# The data treasure trail

# Task 1) import the iris dataset

# Task 2) how many rows are there in the dataset?

# Task 3) what is the mean of comumn [x]?

# Task 4) create a simple plot of the data

# Task 5) import the farm data

# Task 6) add another row to the farm data; farm_id="f9", area_hectares=5, product="milk"
